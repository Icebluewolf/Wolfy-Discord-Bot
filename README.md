## Introduction
This is a Discord Bot That Has Been Created To Help Me Learn Python. This Bot Will Also Help Me With Some Tasks On My Personal Discord Server.
The Technology I Use Is Python 3.7.

I Hope To Open This Bot To Be Able To Handle Multiple Servers In The Future But For Now I Will Not Work On That.
We are getting a bit closer to this goal.

The prefix for all commands on this bot is : `w!`

Please Note As Of This Point This Bot Is Not Capable Of Being On Multiple Servers So There Is Not An Invite Yet.
Should not be much longer

## Custom Responding
I Have A Few Messages That When Said In Chat The Bot Will Auto-Respond To Them.<br>
ex. When You Say "Werf" The Bot Will Respond With "Werf!"
There is no command for this!



## Polls
This Feature Is For Getting The Input Of Others.<br>
You Can Type In A Command And Wolfy Will Make A Custom Embed/Message For Your Poll.
An Example Command For This Is : `w!poll Title, 1d12h, Option 1, Option 2, Etc.`
w!poll Is The Activation For The Command. The Title is The Title Of Your Poll.
The Time Is A Group Of Characters, You Can Use d For Days, h For Hours, m For Minutes, And s for Seconds. 
You Must Do Them In Order (dhms) But, Are Not Required To Use All Fields. If A Field Is Unused It Will Be Set To Zero. 
There Is A Limit Of 20 Options In The Poll Because Of Discords Limit Of 20 Reactions Per Message.



## Whitelisting 
##### (Not Usable For Invited Bot *Yet*)
This command will make it easy for you to allow users that are on your discord to whitelist themselves on your
Minecraft server. As this bot was designed on a discord for a small Minecraft server I thought it would be a 
good idea to add automatic whitelisting. This feature is not available to be used *yet.*
I am current working on a new feature(Custom Settings) that will allow this.
The command for this feature is `w!whitelist IGN` With IGN being the players Minecraft Username they want to whitelist



## Custom Settings 
##### (Coming Soonâ„¢)
Are you tired of people using a command you dont want them to use. Or even Want a command turned off all together.
This feature will allow you to lock a command to only be acceded by specific roles. 
It will also allow you to turn off settings and set up things 
such as connecting you Minecraft server to the whitelist command.
The command for this feature is `w!settings` You will be prompted after this.



## Announcements
This Is Still Being Worked On And More Info Will Come Out In The Future.
##### Update : I have decided that this is not an important feature So It Will Not Be On The To-Do List Anymore



## Lottery Bot O.o
