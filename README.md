## Introduction
This is a Discord Bot That Has Been Created To Help Me Learn Python. This Bot Will Also Help Me With Some Tasks On My Personal Discord Server.
The Technology I Use Is Python 3.7.

I Hope To Open This Bot To Be Able To Handle Multiple Servers In The Future But For Now I Will Not Work On That.

Please Note As Of This Point This Bot Is Not Capable Of Being On Multiple Servers So There Is Not An Invite Yet.

If You Have Any Questions Please Contact Me On Discord Or Open An Issue

## Custom Responding
I Have A Few Messages That When Said In Chat The Bot Will Auto-Respond To Them.
ex. When You Say "Werf" The Bot Will Respond With "Werf!"


## Polls
This Feature Is For Getting The Input Of Others. You Can Type In A Command And Wolfy Will Make A Custom Embed/Message For Your Poll.
An Example Command For This Is : wpoll, Title, 1d12h, Option 1, Option 2, Etc.
wpoll Is The Activation For The Command. The Title is The Title Of Your Poll. The Time Is A Group Of Characters, You Can Use d For Days, h For Hours, m For Minutes, And s for Seconds. You Must Do Them In Order (dhms) But, Are Nor Reqired To Use All Fields. If A Field Is Unused It Will Be Set To Zero. There Is A Limit Of 20 Options In The Poll Because Of Discords Limit Of 20 Reactions Per Message.

## Announcements
This Is Still Being Worked On And More Info Will Come Out In The Future.
