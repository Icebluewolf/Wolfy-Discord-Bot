## Introduction
This is a Discord Bot That Has Been Created To Help Me Learn Python. This Bot Will Also Help Me With Some Tasks On My Personal Discord Server.
The Technology I Use Is Python 3.7.

The prefix for all commands on this bot is : `w!`

## Custom Responding
I Have A Few Messages That When Said In Chat The Bot Will Auto-Respond To Them.<br>
ex. When You Say "Werf" The Bot Will Respond With "Werf!"
There is no command for this!



## Polls
This Feature Is For Getting The Input Of Others.<br>
You Can Type In A Command And Wolfy Will Make A Custom Embed/Message For Your Poll.
An Example Command For This Is : `w!poll Title, 1d12h, Option 1, Option 2, Etc.`
w!poll Is The Activation For The Command. The Title is The Title Of Your Poll.
The Time Is A Group Of Characters, You Can Use d For Days, h For Hours, m For Minutes, And s for Seconds. 
You Must Do Them In Order (dhms) But, Are Not Required To Use All Fields. If A Field Is Unused It Will Be Set To Zero. 
There Is A Limit Of 20 Options In The Poll Because Of Discords Limit Of 20 Reactions Per Message.



## Whitelisting 
##### (Not Usable For Invited Bot *Yet*)
This command will make it easy for you to allow users that are on your discord to whitelist themselves on your
Minecraft server. As this bot was designed on a discord for a small Minecraft server I thought it would be a 
good idea to add automatic whitelisting. This feature is not available to be used *yet.*
I am current working on a new feature(Custom Settings) that will allow this.
The command for this feature is `w!whitelist IGN` With IGN being the players Minecraft Username they want to whitelist



## Custom Settings 
Are you tired of people using a command you dont want them to use.
This feature will allow you to lock a command to only be accessed by specific roles. 
It will also allow you to set up items such as connection to your Minecraft server.
This command comes with 2 options on how to run it. If you are to the command you 
can run `w!settings` to get a step by step walkthrough of the command. 
If you know exactly what you want to do you can run `w!settings <feature> <setting>` 
where feature is what you want to change as a category `EX: poll` and setting is the 
specific thing within the feature you want to change `EX: roles`.



## Announcements
This Is Still Being Worked On And More Info Will Come Out In The Future.
##### Update : I have decided that this is not an important feature So It Will Not Be On The To-Do List Anymore
